For this app to run as intended you'll need too create .env file in root directory with following fields:

MONGODB_URL - URI for your MongoDB database. You can create one and get the URI using MongoDB Atlas
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET - JWT access token, you can use any string you want but, obviously, better use some actual token generated online.
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET - same principal as above, just make sure they aren't the same.

CLOUD_NAME = Cloudinary Cloud name for image hosting
CLOUD_API_KEY = Cloudinary API key
CLOUD_API_SECRET = Cloudinary API secret
